## Personal Website V2

I have decided to recreate a new and improved version of my personal website because the original one was made using PHP. At the time, the portfolio website was the result of a class project, and looked pretty not great. I haven't touched PHP since the end of that class, and the code is not very reusable.

Hopefully, by using React and NextJS, this new website should be easier to maintain and update in the future. Hopefully, there isn't a V3, but technologies change all the time, and I'm more comfortable using Vue at this point that React, so who knows.

This repository will hopefully double as both the source of the code that populates my portfolio website, as well as outlines some components that I can use across other website projects that I take on.
